# Group-10-Section-A-Blockchain-Project

Problem Statement: Our idea solves tampering and spoofing, which are fundamental flaws in the present method of using handwritten prescriptions and filing medical records/receipts. A person may fabricate a prescription in order to obtain medicines to which he or she is addicted to. Medical bills can be forged in order to obtain reimbursement from an insurance company. Another flaw in the existing system is the manner in which a person's medical history is kept. Manual filing of diagnoses that may or may not be adequately accounted for is the most common method. 

Approach: A blockchain will be created to store records of each patient and whenever new patient data  is to be added to the chain, mining will take place. The data will be accessed and uploaded via an online portal.
